                        The Employability Club is an organization which created address the pervasive problem of graduate unemployment in Nigeria.
                      </p><br> 

                      <p>
                        The Employability Club is an organization that helps to address the damage that is done when students solely focus on school work (academics) alone all through their stay in the higher institution, without realizing that there are other departments of their lives that must be developed side-by-side. This is one major cause of graduate unemployment in Nigeria and this is what the The Employability is all out to stop!
                      </p><br>

                      <p>
                        The government and the society are trying to deal with the problem of unemployment among graduates, who already have left school and are already caught in the net of unemployment! it simply cannot work just fine - and this explain why the problem of unemployment in Nigeria isn't just going away!  Most of the unemployment programmes out there tend to focus solely on those who have graduated from various higher institutions and are jobless. However, at TEC, we believe that the best and the most effective way to fight unemployment is to start dealing with it from the campuses, among the undergraduates.

      <h3 class='themes'>The Employability Club operates through the following main themes:</h3>
      <hr class='line1'>
      <div class="row container-fluid text-center">
        <div class='mandel card-body col-md-4'>
            <h5>1. Sensitization and awareness</h5>
              <p> 
                - unless they are told, many undergraduates never realize the implication of having your degree certificate as the only achievement in 4 or 5 years of staying on campus! Many of them never realize that danger until after graduation. Sensitization and awareness aspect of our operations enables us to help undergraduates gain this consciousness on time.<br>

                We work with a special  focus  on  how  current undergraduates  in  Nigerian  higher  institutions  will  not  graduate  to  increase  the  list  of  the  unemployed graduates in the country. We let students in what to do, and what to avoid so as not to experience unemployment when they graduate. 
              </p>
        </div>
        <div class='card-body col-md-4'>
            <h5> 2. Trainings/capacity development</h5>
              <p> 
                - We help undergraduates acquire the SKILLS OF THE FUTURE! We have found reasons why many people graduate and find it difficult to get jobs.  We therefore provide undergraduates with supplementary education programme, that augments our conventional education system by supplying what it lacks!<br>

               We identify skills that are highly demanded and sought for in the corporate world and in the markets, and we bring such skills to campuses so that students can acquire them ahead of graduation.  This is because companies and organizations do not hire faces of people, neither do they hire certificates! In essence, they hire skills -  and how many of them students have to offer at the point of graduation will determine their employability score - and how long it takes for them to secure meaningful and gainful employments, after   graduation.  Meanwhile, The Employability Club's capacity development trainings are free!

        <div class='card-body col-md-4'>
            <h5> 3. Internship and job experience</h5>
              <p>
                - We encourage undergraduates not to wait until graduation before trying to 'gather work experience'.<br>
                We partner with notable companies and organizations to secure job and internship opportunities for students, so they don't have to totally wait until after graduation before experiencing what the actual corporate work environment is like, and we help them to meet the requirements and expectations out there in the real world (the corporate and business worlds), ever before they become graduates. <br>

                We design seamless work-study opportunities that help student earn income right from campus, especially those who really need it. Students who are qualified and are recruited into this scheme will earn monthly stipends throughout their school life.<br>
